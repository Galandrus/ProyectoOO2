## UX-Painter

UX-Painter is a web-extension that enables the creation of a new version of a web application by applying any combination of predefined UI transformations called Client-Side Web Refactorings (CSWRs).

### `Installation`

- It runs in Google Chrome.
- Clone the repository. 
- Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
- Build the extension with `npm run build`.
- Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable the developer mode.
- Load unpacked extension and select the `build` folder of the repository.

Initially the tool shows only the original version of the current application. To create a new version the original one must be extended with one or more CSWRs.
